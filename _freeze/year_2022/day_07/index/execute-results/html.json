The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you're currently in.\n\n## Set-Up\n\nHere reading in the data as a table as it splits out the three potential commands quite nicely:\n\n- `$` means that will either look for `cd` or `ls` in the second column.\n  - `cd` means that the directory will either enter the subdirectory or if the third column is `\"..\"` then move up into the parent column. At no point will we need to move above the home directory.\n  - `ls`, printing the current directory contents, is a red herring and can be ignored\n- `dir` means that a new directory needs to be created in the current directory\n- All other commands are new files of size in the first column\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(readLines(\"input.txt\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n chr [1:956] \"$ cd /\" \"$ ls\" \"dir cmjgvh\" \"dir czrzl\" \"dir fcbt\" \"dir hdh\" ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncommands <- read.table(\"input.txt\", sep = \" \", fill = TRUE, header = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first time helper functions have been needed. This first one finds the directory to move to. I store the active directory as a vector of folder names, with the home directory being `character(0)` (this did have its own issues, however made some indexing handy in the future)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchange_dir <- function(files, dir, curr_dir = character(0)) {\n  if (dir == \"..\") head(curr_dir, -1) else if (dir == \"/\") character(0) else c(curr_dir, dir)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis second helper went iteratively through the commands, and updated the current file structure and the active directory location. Using `[[curr_dir]]` on nested lists was really useful, as `list[[c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")]]` was a very simple way of finding the subdirectory `a -> b -> c`.\n\nIt returns a nested list of the file tree of the data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfollow_commands <- function(commands, files = list(), curr_dir = character(0)) {\n  command <- commands[1, ]\n\n  if (command$V1 == \"$\") {\n    if (command$V2 == \"cd\") {\n      curr_dir <- change_dir(files, command$V3, curr_dir)\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (command$V1 == \"dir\") {\n      new_file <- setNames(list(list()), command$V2)\n    } else {\n      new_file <- setNames(list(as.numeric(command$V1)), command$V2)\n    }\n\n    if (length(curr_dir) > 0) {\n      files[[curr_dir]] <- append(files[[curr_dir]], new_file)\n    } else {\n      files <- append(files, new_file)\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (nrow(commands) == 1) {\n    files\n  } else {\n    follow_commands(commands[-1, ], files = files, curr_dir = curr_dir)\n  }\n}\n\nfiles <- follow_commands(commands)\nstr(files, 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nList of 10\n $ cmjgvh   :List of 7\n $ czrzl    :List of 6\n $ fcbt     :List of 1\n $ hdh      :List of 4\n $ hjsbd.mzp: num 259661\n $ jgrdd    :List of 1\n $ lqblqtng :List of 3\n $ pgvmpmn  :List of 1\n $ pqqcvcm  :List of 2\n $ zglbptq  :List of 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Part 1\n\n> Since the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the total size of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)\n>\n> Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?\n\nThe last helper function is required here. Now we have the file tree, we need to recursively sum up all children files. Here I create a recursive function to grab all of the sub-directories and find their total sizes. Either way, a sum of the directory is calculated.\n\nThe list is then squashed into a vector to easily find the small directories.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_dir_size <- function(files) {\n  dirs <- sapply(files, is.list)\n  if (any(dirs)) {\n    c(\n      directory = sum(unlist(files, recursive = TRUE)),\n      lapply(files[dirs], get_dir_size)\n    )\n  } else {\n    sum(unlist(files, recursive = TRUE))\n  }\n}\n\ndir_sizes <- get_dir_size(files)\nstr(dir_sizes, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nList of 10\n $ directory: num 45174025\n $ cmjgvh   :List of 4\n  ..$ directory: num 1105372\n  ..$ hdh      : num 267125\n  ..$ hgrpfmt  : num 319727\n  ..$ sjgvbd   : num 27997\n $ czrzl    :List of 2\n  ..$ directory: num 1382756\n  ..$ cmh      :List of 3\n $ fcbt     : num 150417\n $ hdh      :List of 5\n  ..$ directory: num 10851370\n  ..$ cljdmh   :List of 8\n  ..$ fptsr    :List of 3\n  ..$ schjz    : num 586947\n  ..$ vrrcrhzs :List of 2\n $ jgrdd    : num 325202\n $ lqblqtng :List of 4\n  ..$ directory: num 27642694\n  ..$ bbzv     : num 326190\n  ..$ gzqqp    :List of 3\n  ..$ vgt      :List of 9\n $ pgvmpmn  : num 18511\n $ pqqcvcm  : num 502736\n $ zglbptq  :List of 4\n  ..$ directory: num 2935306\n  ..$ brhmv    :List of 3\n  ..$ hdh      : num 263470\n  ..$ mhnfrn   :List of 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndir_size_flat <- unlist(dir_sizes, recursive = TRUE)\nsum(dir_size_flat[dir_size_flat <= 100000])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1077191\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Part 2\n\n> Now, you're ready to choose a directory to delete.\n>\n> The total disk space available to the filesystem is 70000000.
