Next!\" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!\n\n## Set-Up\n\n> As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.\n> \n> This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninput <- readLines(\"input.txt\") |> strsplit(\"\") |> do.call(what = rbind)\ncollapse <- \\(...) sapply(list(...), paste, collapse = \"\")\ninput[1:10, 1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n [1,] \"X\"  \"X\"  \"A\"  \"M\"  \"X\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \n [2,] \"S\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"X\"  \"M\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"X\"  \n [3,] \"X\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \n [4,] \"S\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"M\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"M\"  \n [5,] \"X\"  \"M\"  \"A\"  \"S\"  \"X\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \"X\"  \n [6,] \"A\"  \"S\"  \"X\"  \"M\"  \"X\"  \"X\"  \"A\"  \"X\"  \"X\"  \"X\"  \n [7,] \"X\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \"X\"  \n [8,] \"S\"  \"X\"  \"A\"  \"S\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"X\"  \"A\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \n [9,] \"A\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"M\"  \"X\"  \"X\"  \"A\"  \n[10,] \"M\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \"S\"  \"X\"  \"X\"  \"A\"  \"A\"  \"S\"  \"M\"  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Part 1\n\n> Take a look at the little Elf's word search. How many times does XMAS appear?\n\nKnowing it was a square matrix, could've just used one of the dimensions, but essentially going for each cell and looking 4 to the right, down, up-right and down-right for \"XMAS\" or \"SAMX\" to avoid having to look in 8 directions for \"XMAS\" in each cell.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninput_size <- dim(input)\ncheck_cell <- \\(i, j) {\n  max_col <- min(3, input_size[2] - j)\n  max_row <- min(3, input_size[1] - i)\n  max_dim <- min(max_col, max_row)\n\n  strings <- collapse(\n    input[i, j + 0:max_col],\n    input[i + 0:max_row, j],\n    input[cbind(i + 0:max_dim, j + 0:max_dim)],\n    input[cbind(i + 0:max_dim, j + max_dim:0)]\n  )\n\n  sum(strings %in% c(\"XMAS\", \"SAMX\"))\n}\n\nsapply(seq(input_size[2L]), \\(j) sapply(seq(input_size[1L]), check_cell, j = j)) |> sum()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2662\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Part 2\n\n> The Elf looks quizzically at you. Did you misunderstand the assignment?\n>\n> Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn't actually an XMAS puzzle; it's an X-MAS puzzle in which you're supposed to find two MAS in the shape of an X.\n>\n> Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side and try again. How many times does an X-MAS appear?\n\nSimplified the conditions from part one to only look at diagonals using the top left as the start of the \"X\" meant that would only ever consider each \"A\" once.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_cell_2 <- \\(i, j) {\n  max_col <- min(2, input_size[2] - j)\n  max_row <- min(2, input_size[1] - i)\n  max_dim <- min(max_col, max_row)\n\n  strings <- collapse(\n    input[cbind(i + 0:max_dim, j + 0:max_dim)],\n    input[cbind(i + 0:max_dim, j + max_dim:0)]\n  )\n\n  all(strings %in% c(\"MAS\", \"SAM\"))\n}\n\nsapply(seq(input_size[2L]), \\(j) sapply(seq(input_size[1L]), check_cell_2, j = j)) |> sum()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2034\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
